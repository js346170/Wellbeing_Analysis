2/19/2025 13:58:14,0 / 2,6,10,5,8,10,7,6,10,"Overall, I think the mindful moments are really helpful and that it usually boosts my mood for the day. However, more things couls be put into action to make it a bit more affective. For instance, I believe we could incorporate a few new and unique ideas that could just keep our mind off school for a second. It could be things like a small game activity because, for me, it really would help if I were able to focus on a fun thing instead of stressing out about undone homework or the next class. =))) ",

2/20/2025 13:40:44,0 / 2,10,8,10,10,10,8,7,8,,"I really enjoy the idea of mindful moments! However it'd be nice if those who do the mindful moments could keep the pacing slow and serious instead of trying to be sarcastic, funny and goofing around. I also would not mind if we extend the time for mindful moments outside just the usual 1-2 minutes, since we usually have 5 minutes of early dismissal, because personally, it really helps calm and slow me down to get started for the day."

2/20/2025 14:03:46,0 / 2,6,8,9,9,9,7,8,9,"To make the Mindful Moment more enjoyable and engaging for me, I’d love for it to be more interactive—maybe with a quick challenge or a fun breathing exercise. It would be great if it felt more personal, like taking a moment to reflect on something I’m grateful for or setting a small goal for the day. Adding calming visuals or relaxing music could also make it more peaceful. I think keeping it short and meaningful would make it feel like a refreshing break rather than just another task. 😍😉😘",
