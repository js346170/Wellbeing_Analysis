However, more things couls be put into action to make it a bit more affective. For instance, I believe we could incorporate a few new and unique ideas that could just keep our mind off school for a second. It could be things like a small game activity because, for me, it really would help if I were able to focus on a fun thing instead of stressing out about undone homework or the next class. =))) ",

However it'd be nice if those who do the mindful moments could keep the pacing slow and serious instead of trying to be sarcastic, funny and goofing around. I also would not mind if we extend the time for mindful moments outside just the usual 1-2 minutes, since we usually have 5 minutes of early dismissal, because personally, it really helps calm and slow me down to get started for the day."

It would be great if it felt more personal, like taking a moment to reflect on something Iâm grateful for or setting a small goal for the day. Adding calming visuals or relaxing music could also make it more peaceful.
